# APT Purge Old Trash
Script to get rid of files left behind by packages that are removed using "apt remove" and not "apt purge". This script is for Linux systems configured to use APT (advanced package tool) i.e. Debian, Ubuntu and their derivatives.
```sh
wget https://tildegit.org/shouko/Script-APT-Purge-Old-Trash/raw/branch/master/remove-residual-package-files.sh && chmod +x remove-residual-package-files.sh && ./remove-residual-package-files.sh
   ```
